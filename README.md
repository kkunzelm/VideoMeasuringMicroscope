# VideoMeasuringMicroscope

This project is working, but has a few minor issues. It is superseeded by the project [TriScope](github.com/kkunzelm/TriScope).

Desktop application for a motorised video measuring microscope. Combines live camera acquisition with precision stage control to enable dimensional measurements directly from the camera image or via stage displacement.

## Features

- Live camera feed — IDS Peak (GenICam) and V4L2 (USB webcam) cameras
- XYZ stage control — Lang LStep 23 (MCL3 protocol) and DIY stepper
- Measurement overlays — distance, angle, radius with µm/pixel calibration
- **Table measurement mode** — zero the stage position at a reference point and read the XY displacement to a second point with stage precision
- Crosshair and 10×10 grid overlays

## Build

### Prerequisites

| Dependency | Minimum version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| CMake | 3.20 | |
| Qt | 6.4 | Widgets, SerialPort modules |
| OpenCV | 4.x | imgproc, imgcodecs |
| IDS Peak SDK | 2.x | Optional; only needed for IDS GenICam cameras |
| Linux kernel | any recent | V4L2 support for USB webcams |

### Build steps

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build . -j$(nproc)
```

Run via the wrapper script (sets up library paths):

```bash
./VideoMeasuringMicroscope.sh
```

## Sidebar layout

The sidebar is split into two tabs:

| Tab | Contents |
|---|---|
| **Connect** | Camera discovery/selection, exposure, gain, streaming — Stage port, type, Connect/Disconnect, Home (Calibrate), Measure Range |
| **Evaluate** | Unit toggle (mm/µm), XYZ position display, ΔX/ΔY table measurement, Jog step + buttons, Go to Position, Abort — Crosshair/Grid overlays — Distance/Angle/Radius measurement tools |

Start in the **Connect** tab to set up hardware. Switch to **Evaluate** for measurement work.

## Quick-start workflow

### 1 — Connect and start the camera  *(Connect tab)*

1. Click **↺** to discover available devices.
2. Select the camera from the dropdown (auto-selected after refresh).
3. Click **Start Streaming**.
4. Adjust **Exposure** and **Gain** sliders until the image is well-exposed.

### 2 — Connect the stage  *(Connect tab)*

1. Select the serial port from the port dropdown (e.g. `/dev/ttyUSB0`). Click **↺** next to the dropdown if the port is not listed (the list is refreshed on demand).
2. Select stage type: **LStep 23** or **DIY Stepper**.
3. Click **Connect**. The stage sends its initialisation sequence automatically; the position display (in the Evaluate tab) updates to show the current hardware position.

> **Shutdown:** click **Disconnect** before closing the application, or simply close the window — the application sends an abort command and closes the serial port cleanly either way. Hard-resetting the LStep23 after a crash should no longer be necessary.

### 3 — Home / Calibrate  *(Connect tab)*

Click **Home (Calibrate)**.

All three axes drive to their home switches (the zero reference). This takes approximately 10–15 s. After calibration the software origin (0, 0, 0) corresponds to the home-switch position.

**Always calibrate after powering on the stage.** Without a calibration the displayed coordinates are meaningless.

### 4 — Set travel range (Measure Range)  *(Connect tab)*

After homing, click **Measure Range**.

All axes drive to their opposite end-switches (~20–30 s) to measure the full travel. The measured values are stored and used for coordinate display. Run this once per session, after Calibrate.

### 5 — Jog the stage  *(Evaluate tab)*

Select a step size (0.001 mm – 50 mm) and click the ±X / ±Y / ±Z buttons.

The Z axis uses reduced speed and a gentle ramp so that the electromagnetic holding brake has time to disengage before the motor accelerates. If Z does not move on the first click, try a slightly larger step.

### 6 — Go to absolute position  *(Evaluate tab)*

Enter target X, Y, Z coordinates in the **Go to Position** spinboxes and click **Move**. The stage drives to the entered coordinates in one move.

### 7 — Pixel / µm calibration (for image measurements)  *(Evaluate tab)*

Required before using Distance / Angle / Radius overlays in real-world units.

1. Place a reference object of known size in the field of view.
2. Click **Distance** and mark the start and end of the known dimension on the image.
3. Enter the known real-world length in the **µm** spinbox and the measured pixel count in the **px** spinbox.
4. Click **Set**. All subsequent overlay measurements are shown in µm.

Alternatively, move the stage a known distance (e.g. 1.000 mm via a jog), mark the displacement of a feature in the image, and enter 1000 µm as the reference length.

### 8 — Table measurement (XY distances via stage)  *(Evaluate tab)*

This mode measures distances using stage movement rather than image pixels, giving sub-micron repeatability.

1. Enable the **Crosshair** overlay (Overlays section) so the image centre is marked.
2. Jog until the first point of interest is exactly at the crosshair centre.
3. Click **Set Origin (Zero ΔX/ΔY)** — the ΔX and ΔY displays reset to 0.
4. Jog until the second point of interest is at the crosshair centre.
5. Read **ΔX** and **ΔY** — these are the true stage displacements and equal the distance between the two points in X and Y.

The unit toggle (mm / µm) applies to both the absolute position display and the ΔX / ΔY display.

## Measurement overlay tools

| Tool | Input | Output |
|---|---|---|
| Distance | Click 2 points | Length between points |
| Angle | Click 3 points | Angle at the middle point |
| Radius | Click 3 points on an arc | Radius of the best-fit circle |
| Clear | Button | Remove all annotations |

The result is displayed as a text label anchored to the annotation in the video (white text with a dark shadow for legibility on any background). The completed measurement is also shown in the status bar.

**Continuous measurement:** after the final point the annotation stays highlighted (thicker lines). The next click anywhere in the image clears the old result and starts a fresh measurement of the same type — the click becomes point 1. To stop measuring, click **Clear** or switch to a different tool.

## Longterm / planned

- **IDS camera hardware ROI** — expose a "Zoom In" control that uses the GenICam `Width`, `Height`, `OffsetX`, `OffsetY` nodes to crop the sensor region. This reduces USB bandwidth, increases frame rate on the selected region, and avoids software scaling artefacts.

## Coordinate system

Right-handed system, ISO 841 / G-code convention:

| Axis | Zero position | Positive direction |
|---|---|---|
| X | Home switch (left) | → right |
| Y | Home switch (front) | → back |
| Z | Home switch (top) | ↑ up (objective direction) |

After Calibrate + Measure Range the stage reports positions in mm. The Z axis is normally negative during use (stage below the objective).
